# Indian Sign Language Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection** using deep learning techniques. The dataset was collected manually using a **laptop camera**, and various preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance the quality of the data. The model was trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** with architectures like **InceptionV3** and **ResNet18**.

## 📝 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Collection:**
  - Images were captured manually using a **laptop camera**.
  - Multiple variations of each sign were recorded to improve model generalization.
  
- **Preprocessing Techniques:**
  - Applied various **filters** to enhance image quality.
  - Used **thresholding methods** to separate the **hand** from the **background**.
  - Converted images to a format suitable for deep learning models.
